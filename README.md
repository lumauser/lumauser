# About Me
Hi! I am Lumauser! A intermediate programmer who mostly specializes in Python and Javascript. I have been coding for about 3 years and am a self-taught programmer using documentation and YouTube videos to learn. I'm working on projects using Python and Javascript and continuing to master these programming languages. I don't post a lot of new repositories that often but I am planning to do so in the future. If you want to contact me, feel free to email me. Email: jihoepicgames@gmail.com (ik its quirky)
